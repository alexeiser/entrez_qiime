Latest release: [https://github.com/bakerccm/entrez_qiime/releases/tag/v2.0](https://github.com/bakerccm/entrez_qiime/releases/tag/v2.0)

- Version v2.0 involves a major update to entrez_qiime.py and its documentation. This script now takes an input FASTA file with NCBI accession numbers as sequence identifiers, in preparation for the NCBI phasing out GI numbers in sequence downloads. See the release documentation for additional changes.

- Initial release: [https://github.com/bakerccm/entrez_qiime/releases/tag/v1.0](https://github.com/bakerccm/entrez_qiime/releases/tag/v1.0)

Version v1.0 is the formal GitHub release of the original utility, which has been circulating outside GitHub since 2012. In v1.0, the Python script entrez_qiime.py takes an input FASTA file with GI numbers as sequence identifiers.
